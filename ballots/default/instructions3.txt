Washington has a new election system. In eash race for partisan office, the two candidates who receive the most votes in the August Primary advance to the November General Election. Each candidate for partisan office may state a political party that he or she prefers. A candidate's preference does not imply that the candidate is nominated or endorsed by the party, or that the party approves of or associates with that candidate. The election for President and Vice-President is different. Candidates for President and Vice-President are the official nominees of their political party.
